Wezterm is a my new favorite terminal emulator. It's been fun to create some customizations for it using the lua programming language. In this video, I'll show you how I swap out background images, fonts, and color schemes using lua. I'll also show you a tip for how to get rid of the notch if you have a MacBook.

Here's the helper function I created to get a random entry from a table:

```lua title=".config/wezterm/utils/helpers.lua"
local wezterm = require("wezterm")
local M = {}

M.get_random_entry = function(tbl)
  local keys = {}
  for key, _ in ipairs(tbl) do
    table.insert(keys, key)
  end
  local randomKey = keys[math.random(1, #keys)]
  return tbl[randomKey]
end

return M
```

You can view all of my Wezterm configure here:
