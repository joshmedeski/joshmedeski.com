In my previous post, [Smart tmux sessions with zoxide and fzf](/posts/smart-tmux-sessions-with-zoxide-and-fzf), I discussed combining fzf and zoxide to create a smart script that would allow you to quickly and easily create and switch to tmux sessions. The video has been seen by tens of thousands of people have watched that video and I'm happy to announce that the script has been converted into a tmux plugin with even more features!

If you want to see the features in action, check out the video above. It only takes a few minutes to get started, and it improves itself the more you use it!

Check out the [GitHub Repo: joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager](https://github.com/joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager) to get started with install instructions.
