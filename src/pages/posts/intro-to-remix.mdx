# Philosophy

https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/philosophy

1. Embrace the server/client model, including separation of source code from content/data.
2. Work with, not against, the foundations of the web: Browsers, HTTP, and HTML. Itâ€™s always been good and it's gotten really good in the last few years.
3. Use JavaScript to augment the user experience by emulating browser behavior.
4. Don't over-abstract the underlying technologies
