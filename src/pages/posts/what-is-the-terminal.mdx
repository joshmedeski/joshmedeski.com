Terminology related to the terminal are often misinterpreted. The terminal is kind of a scary thing for some people. So I want to demystify how it works and break down the different terms.

## Terminal App

A terminal application is a computer program that emulates the terminal environment on your computer. Every operating system comes with a built-in terminal application, but there are many third-party applications that can be found online (both open-source and paid).

## Shell Environment

Next, the shell is an environment to interact with your computer. There are multiple shell environments to choose from, but they all have a base set of commands (like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`) that allows you to interact with your computer at a lower-level.

The most basic shell environment is `sh` and the most common is `bash`. In recent years, Apple decided to make `zsh` their default shell and I, personally, use one called `fish`. Each one offers different features and each can be customized in different ways.

If your not sure which shell environment you are using, running `echo $SHELL` will output your shell.

## Extending Functionality

Once you have chosen and setup your shell environment, you can continue to extend the functionality of your terminal by adding third-party scripts called binaries. For example, [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) a fuzzy finder CLI (command-line interface). To install it, I recommend the [homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager for macOS (`brew install fzf`).

Once installed, the `fzf` binary (which is a file) is stored to your path. The path is a set of directories for your shell environment to look for files that can run. This is defined in your shell environment and tools downloaded from brew are typically stored at `/opt/homebrew/bin`. There are also many binaries pre-installed on your computer (beyond `zsh`) in `/usr/sbin`.

The most important thing to know is that these scripts that your run have full access to your computer, so make sure to download them responsibly!

## Closing Thoughts

Binaries or we can use third party package tools like home brew to install additional binaries onto our computer. I hope all of this makes sense. Let's chat for a second.

I think the terminal is an interesting and exciting environment to do, complex things. You can automate your life in a lot of ways with this. Most importantly, as a programmer, you can develop and extend it. I recommend you ease into it, and take it one step at a time.

So that's the terminal. Feel free to head to YouTube and leave a comment if you have any questions.
