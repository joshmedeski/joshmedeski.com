Here's a quick and simple solution for deleting Mac apps in record time! It uses Alfred, my favorite productivity app, and a handy little app that scans your system for related files for a thorough uninstall.

## AppCleaner

AppCleaner is a powerful little app that scans your system for all the files and folders related to an application so you can thoroughly remove an app from your system.

## Alfred Workflow

Jonas Eriksen (aiyodk) has created a Alfred workflow that implements Alfred's powerful search feature with AppCleaner. Simply type "un" and search for the app you want to uninstall.

## Instructions

Once you've installed AppCleaner and the Alfred workflow, follow these 2 easy steps.

### 1. Use Alfred to locate the app

Type "un" then the name of the app you want to delete (in my case it's Candybar)

### 2. Delete the files in AppCleaner

    width={500}

  />

Next, AppCleaner will pop up with all the necessary files to delete to remove the app. Click the "delete" button and your all done!

That's it! You could use AppCleaner by itself but with the help of Alfred it's extremely quick and easy to delete mac apps from your system.

Did you find this helpful? Is there something missing in this workflow that I should know about deleting mac apps? Let me know in the comments below.
