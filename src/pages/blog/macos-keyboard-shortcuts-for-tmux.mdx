As a longtime macOS user, I am used to using the command key to get a lot done. You're probably familar with `cmd+c` for copying to the clipboard, and `cmd+t` to create a new tab in Safari. Most power users agree that staying away from the mouse and keeping your hands on the keyboard for as long as possible will help you be faster and more efficient while working.

Unfortunately, tmux is a tool used in the terminal that doesn't leverage the command key at all, but rather all of it's commands are prefixed with the keystroke `ctrl+b` followed by a letter (ex: new window is `ctrl+b c`). I spent months building the muscle memory for the tmux keybindings, but it always felt slow compared to the macOS keyboard shortcuts.

So, using the [Alacritty terminal emulator](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), I found a way to customize tmux with my own macOS style keyboard shortcuts using the command key.

In this article, I'm going to show you how to create your own keyboard shortcut for tmux. We will go through the following steps:

1. Decide the keyboard shortcut
2. Get the hex code
3. Assign it to Alacritty

## 1. Decide the keyboard shortcut

Before you can assign the keyboard shortcut you have to decide what you want it to do. tmux uses a prefix (default: `control+b`) followed by a key to run a key binding. In macOS, keyboard shortcuts are driven by the command key plus an additional key.

As an example, you can create a new tmux window with `prefix+c`. tmux windows share the same UI pattern as tabs in macOS (ex: Safari tabs or Finder tabs). New tabs in macOS are created with the `cmd+t` keyboard shortcut.

So let's bind new tmux window to `cmd+t`.

## 2. Get the hex code

In order to simulate a keystroke, Alacritty uses hex codes, which is simply a combination of characters.

For our example, we need to get the hex code values for `<ctrl+b> c`. We will use `xxd` to record our keystrokes and dump the hex codes we need.

First run the following command (outside of tmux):
```
xxd -psd
```

Then type `ctrl+b`, `c`, then press the return key (aka `enter`). You will see the following data output in your terminal:

```
^Bc
02630a
```

Press `ctrl+c` to escape the xxd listener. You now have the hex code `02630a`, which stands for `ctrl+b c return`.

## 3. Assign it to Alacritty

Keystroke hex codes are bound to two character at a time. So from our code `02630a`, `02` stands for `ctrl+b`, `63` stands for `c`, and `0a` stands for `return`. Since we don't need the return key, we can drop it. Alacritty also wants us to escape each code with `\x{hex}` so the `chars` we want to use for `<prefix-b> c` will be `\x02\x63`.

Finally, we will use the `key` and `mods` keys to define the custom key binding. Add the following code to your `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml` config file.

```yml
key_bindings:
  - { key: T, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x63" }
```

Now, while inside tmux, you can hit `cmd+t` to create a new window! The principles learned here can be applied to any key binding with any keystroke combination you can think of.

## Bonus: Additional Shortcuts

Here are some of the tmux keybindings I have set up with Alacritty to create more macOS like keyboard shortcuts:

```yaml
key_bindings:
  # Rename the current tmux window
  - { key: Comma, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x2c" }
  # Select a new tmux session for the attached client interactively
  - { key: K, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x73" }
  # Select window 1-9
  - { key: Key1, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x31" }
  - { key: Key2, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x32" }
  - { key: Key3, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x33" }
  - { key: Key4, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x34" }
  - { key: Key5, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x35" }
  - { key: Key6, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x36" }
  - { key: Key7, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x37" }
  - { key: Key8, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x38" }
  - { key: Key9, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x39" }
  # Switch to last tmux session
  - { key: L, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x4c" }
  - { key: LBracket, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x5b" }
  # Change to the previous tmux window
  - { key: LBracket, mods: Command|Shift, chars: "\x02\x70" }
  # Split the current pane into two, left and right
  - { key: N, mods: Command|Shift, chars: "\x02\x25" }
  # Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
  - { key: N, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x22" }
  # Detach the current tmux client
  - { key: Q, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x64" }
  # Change to the next tmux window
  - { key: RBracket, mods: Command|Shift, chars: "\x02\x6e" }
  # Type <escape>:w<enter> to save neovim
  - { key: S, mods: Command, chars: "\x1b\x3a\x77\x0a" }
  # Create a new tmux window
  - { key: T, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x63" }
  # Break the current tmux pane out of the tmux window
  - { key: T, mods: Command|Shift, chars: "\x02\x21" }
  # Kill the current tmux pane (and window if last pane)
  - { key: W, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x78" }
  # Toggle the zoom state of the current tmux pane
  - { key: Z, mods: Command, chars: "\x02\x7a" }
```
