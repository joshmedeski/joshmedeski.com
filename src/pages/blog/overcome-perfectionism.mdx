Perfectionism is stopping you from growing your business, building your cause, and doing what you love. It's important to face this problem head on. Here are 3 tips to overcome perfectionism.

## Get yourself out there

My advice to overcome perfectionism is remind yourself that nothing's perfect the first time around. You just have to get your product, opt-in, blog post, podcast, video, newsletter, book, performance out there and see what happens. Getting yourself out there is the first step.

## People don't like perfect (be authentic instead)

I've been working on a personal project for over 6 months now and I realize that people don't like perfect. In fact, authenticity is more important than perfection. It something is too "perfect" it comes off as too-good-to-be-true and unauthentic (or even sleazy). You have to do you best work and allow your flaws to show in order to win people's trust.

## There is no "RIGHT" way

There is always more than one way to do something, and your never going to know which way is best for you until you make mistakes and learn the wrong way to do it.
