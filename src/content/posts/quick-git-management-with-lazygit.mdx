Git is a central part of the development workflow. It's important to have a good understanding of how it works and how to use it. [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a terminal UI for git that makes it easy to run common git commands efficiently and with ease.

## Install

To install lazygit, you guessed it, run the following homebrew command.

```sh
brew install lazygit
```

It can be opened by moving to a in your teriminal to a git repository and run the `lazygit` command. It will open a terminal UI that offers a lot of useful git commands. You can view the available commands by pressing `?`.

### Custom shortcut

As mentioned in the [tmux intro](/posts/manage-terminal-sessions-with-tmux), we can setup lazygit to a custom macOS style shortcut `cmd+g`. This can be done by adding the following to your `~/.tmux.conf` file.

```sh title="~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf"
bind g new-window -n 'lazygit' lazygit
```

This will bind lazygit to `<prefix>g` in tmux. To map that to `cmd+g` add the following to your alacritty config file in the `key_bindings` section.

```yaml title="~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml"
key_bindings:
  # ... existing keybindings
  - { key: G, mods: Command, chars: "\x02g" } # open git manager 'jesseduffield/lazygit'
```

Now, you can press `cmd+g` to open lazygit from anywhere in your terminal. You can press `q` while in lazygit to close it and return to wherever you where previously.

## Configure

For macOS, the configuration is located in the user application support file. Here are a few basic configuration options.

```yaml title="/Users/josh/Library/Application Support/lazygit/config.yml"
gui:
  showIcons: true
  theme:
    activeBorderColor:
      - magenta
      - bold
    inactiveBorderColor:
      - black
  showFileTree: true # for rendering changes files in a tree format
os:
  editCommand: "nvim"
  editCommandTemplate: "{{editor}} {{filename}}"
keybinding:
  universal:
    quit: "q"
```

## How to use

Using lazygit is pretty straight forward. Here are a few common commands that I use often.

- `space` toggles the selected file to the staging area
- `c` opens the commit window, which lets you write a commit message and commit the staged changes
- `P` pushes the current branch to the remote

There are many more commands including branch management, interacting with history, and more.

## Conclusion

`lazygit` is the quickest and easier way to manage git repositories. It's a great tool to have in your toolbelt and I highly recommend it. Binding to `cmd+g` makes it very quick to open and close. I recommend looking through the [lazygit wiki](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/wiki) to learn more about creating custom commands and more.
