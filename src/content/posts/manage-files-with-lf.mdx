[`lf`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gokcehan/lf) is a terminal file manager. Having to constantly change directories with the `cd` command and preview files with `cat` can be slow and repetitive. `lf` allows you to quickly navigate your filesystem and preview files with a single vim-like commands.

## Install

Install it homebrew with the following command.

```sh
brew install lf
```
