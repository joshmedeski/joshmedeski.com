Intro

Why Sqlite is great for local development

```astro
---
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const publishers = await prisma.publisher.findMany({
  where: { imageUrl: { not: null } },
  select: { imageUrl: true, name: true },
});
---

<section class="bg-slate-300 px-4 py-8">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-lg text-center">
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">As Seen On</h2>
    <section class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center space-x-6">
      {
        publishers.map(({ imageUrl, name }) => (
          <Image src={imageUrl} alt={name} class="max-h-[70px] max-w-[200px]" />
        ))
      }
    </section>
    <a href="/appearances" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">
      View Appearances
    </a>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Deploying with Netlify

The `binaryTargets` will make sure that the Netlify environment installs the proper dependencies to generate the Prisma client for the build. Make sure add them to your `schema.prisma` configuration.

```prisma title="prism/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native","darwin","debian-openssl-1.1.x"]
}
```

```toml {4}
[build.environment]
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version" # prevent Netlify npm install
[build]
  command = 'npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && prisma migrate dev && npm run build'
  publish = 'dist'
```

You'll notice `prisma migrate dev` has been added after pnpm has installed the dependencies but before the site gets built. This will generate the Prisma client which is needed to build the site.

I recommend pushing your site's code to GitHub and connecting the repository to Netlify so when you push to the `main` branch your site gets automatically deployed! You can also open pull requests and get preview URLs before you site goes live.

## Summary

So that's it! We've gone over how to setup and use Prisma an Astro using a SQlite database for easier development and quick deployments through Netlify.
