[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is a minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell. I've been [interviewing developers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdtuRouvdurxRCLs_PnVBVxd9pc2po1em) recently and the majority of them are using Starship! It's easy to setup and configure. Here's how to get started.

## Install

Install starship by running the following brew command.

```sh
brew install starship
```

Now that starship is installed, you have to source it in your `config.fish` by adding the following line.

```sh title="~/.config/fish/config.fish"
starship init fish | source
```

## Configuration

To configure starship, create a `~/.config/starship.toml` and add the following content.

First, swap out some of the characters with custom Nerd Font options. You can find more on [Nerd Font's website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet).

```toml title="~/.config/starship.toml"
[character]
success_symbol = "[\uf054](white)" # 
vicmd_symbol = "[\ue62b](white)" # 
error_symbol = "[\uf467](red)" # 
```

Next, I prefer changing the directory name to blue, since we'll be updating tmux in a future post to the same color as well, creating a consistent style.

```toml title="~/.config/starship.toml"
[directory]
style = "blue bold"
```

Finally, I prefer a more minimal approach to my prompt, so I prefer disabling many of the built in modules.

```toml title="~/.config/starship.toml"
[package]
disabled = true

[username]
disabled = true

[hostname]
disabled = true

[aws]
disabled = true

[docker_context]
disabled = true

[git_branch]
disabled = true

[git_commit]
disabled = true

[git_state]
disabled = true

[git_metrics]
disabled = true

[git_status]
disabled = true
```

Check out all the [configuration options](https://starship.rs/config/) to figure out which modules you can configure or customize to your liking.

## Summary

That's it! Starship works great out-of-the-box and has a low learning-curve. It is smart and will provide contextual information related to where you are in the terminal. With a few customizations it has a minimal and consistent look making it a great addition to my dev workflow.
