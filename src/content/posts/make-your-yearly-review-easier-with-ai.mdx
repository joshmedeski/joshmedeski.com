AI tools like ChatGPT can make the process of doing a yearly review much easier! I'll go over the AI prompt and process that I used this year for my yearly review.

AI has made my life a lot easier and I'm excited to share with you how I used it to make my yearly review easier.

## The Tools

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for all my note-taking, including journaling my yearly review, and [Raycast AI](https://www.raycast.com/pro) for ChatGPT integration on macOS.

## Prompt

The following prompt will generate questions for your yearly review:

```
You are a productivity coach, you will help me align
my life with what's most important to me. I am doing
a yearly review and I will be reflecting on the last
year and thinking about the year ahead. Give me a
group of questions that will help me with each area
of my life. Wait until I give you an area then give
me the questions as bullet points in markdown.
```

Then provide it with an area of your life, such as: "health", "fitness", or "hobbies" and it will generate a list of questions for you to answer.

## Areas

## Bonus prompt formula

Creating a prompt forumla will help your results be more consistent and focused on your needs. Here is the formula I use to generate better results.

```
{role} {purpose} {context} {instructions} {conditions}
```
