My friend, [Brandon Boswell](https://brandonkboswell.com/), recently sat down again with me. I'm in the process of adopting [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). We cover what Brandon has learned over the last 2 years of using Obsidian and some tips heâ€™s found for finishing the creative process to actually deliver more content. We also cover a bunch of tips and best practices for getting the most out of Obsidian.
