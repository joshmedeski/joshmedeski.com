Fish (Friendly Interactive SHell) is a Unix shell designed to be user-friendly and interactive. It features syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and a built-in help system, among other features. Fish aims to be more intuitive and easier to use than traditional Unix shells like Bash, while still providing powerful scripting capabilities. Modern macOS computers ship with zsh as the default shell, you can check out [Why I Switched from zsh to fish](/posts/why-i-switched-from-zsh-to-fish) but the main reasons are the speed, simplicity, autosuggestions and vim mode that the fish shell offers.

## Installing fish

Fish does not come pre-installed on macOS, you have to install it with Homebrew by running the following command in the terminal.

```sh
brew install fish
```

If you're not familiar with Homebrew, check out [Managing macOS packages with Homebrew](/posts/managing-macos-packages-with-homebrew).

## Making fish your default shell

Now that the fish shell is installed, you have to manually change the default shell by completing the following steps.

First, you will need to get the path to the fish shell executable. If you're unfamiliar with how executables in the terminal work, I recommend checking out [What is the terminal?](/posts/what-is-the-terminal). Run the following `which` command.

```sh
which fish
```

The command will output something similar to `/opt/homebrew/bin/fish`. Copy the value from your terminal and add it to the `/etc/shells` file. You'll want to edit the file using the `sudo` command, since this is an system-level file that lists valid login shells for user accounts. Here is how to update it using `vi`.

```sh
sudo vi /etc/shells
```

Enter your user password to open the file then add the fish shell's path as an new line in the file and save it.

```sh
# List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
# Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
# one of these shells.

/opt/homebrew/bin/fish # use output from `which fish`
/bin/bash
/bin/csh
/bin/dash
/bin/ksh
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/zsh
```

If you're unfamiliar with `vi`, I recommend running `vimtutor` in your terminal which will guide you through the basics of how to edit text from inside the terminal.

Now that you've added fish as a valid login shell for macOS, you can run the `chsh` (change shell) command to change the default login shell.

```sh
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish # use output from `which fish`
```

You may be prompted, again, to enter your user password and when the command is completed your login shell is now switched to fish, congrats! Now, close and reopen the terminal window for the changes to take effect.

## Configuring fish

Fish configuration is written in [its own scripting language](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#language). The entry point for configuring the fish shell is the `config.fish` file which can be created with the following command.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish && touch ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

This command first creates the `~/.config/fish` directory with the `-p` option, which creates any parent directories that do not exist. Then it creates the `config.fish` file inside the `~/.config/fish` directory using the `touch` command. Note: all of fish's configuration files are stored in `~/.config/fish` more of which will explore later.

### Add directories to `PATH`

In fish, the `fish_add_path` function is used to add directories to the `PATH` environment variable. Adding directories to your system's `PATH` environment variable allows you to run programs located in those directories from anywhere on your system without specifying the full path. By doing so, you extend the list of directories that the shell searches for executables, making it more convenient to run programs and execute commands.

To add support for Homebrew executables to the fish shell, add the following lines to your `~/.config.fish` file.

```fish
fish_add_path /opt/homebrew/bin
fish_add_path /opt/homebrew/sbin
```

### Setting environment variables

In the Fish shell, the `set` command is used to create and modify shell variables. Shell variables are used to store values that can be referenced and reused throughout a shell session or script. Here are some common variables that are helpful.

```fish
set -U fish_greeting # disable fish greeting
set -U fish_key_bindings fish_vi_key_bindings
```

The `-U` flag is used with the `set` command to create or modify a universal variable. Universal variables are similar to regular variables, but they have a global scope and can be accessed from any shell session or script.

The `fish_greeting` variable is used to customize the greeting message that is displayed when a new shell session is started. By default, the greeting message includes the Fish version number and a welcome message. Since I am constantly spinning up new shells in my development workflow, I prefer to disable the fish greeting by setting it with not value.

The `fish_vi_key_bindings` variable allows you to hit escape while writing a command in fish to switch to a vi-mode to easily manipulate your command before running it. Just like vi, you can hit `i` to get back to insert mode.

The next most common variable to change is the default editor for your shell. This is set with the `EDITOR` variable.

```fish
set -Ux EDITOR nvim
```

Note the `-x` flag is used with the `set` command to export a variable as an environment variable. When a variable is exported, it becomes available to child processes and can be accessed by programs and utilities that use environment variables. This is helpful as you extend your development environment with other tools that can generate sub processes
