Wezterm is a my new favorite terminal emulator. It's been fun to create some customizations for it using the lua programming language. In this video, I'll show you how I swap out background images, fonts, and color schemes using lua. I'll also show you a tip for how to get rid of the notch if you have a MacBook.

You can view all of my Wezterm configure here:
