I've been using the `zsh` terminal with the infamous [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework for many years now. The features and improvements it makes on plain old bash are impressive. But as my needs change, so does my shell. I made the switch to the `fish` shell almost a year ago and here is why I switched.

## Speed

`fish` is faster than `zsh`. Especially when using `zsh` plugins the loading time alone is significantly slower. But more than that, the overall experience for me feels snappier and more responsive in the `fish` shell. Since I'm using the terminal to be more efficient and get things done faster than a GUI, speed is one of my top requirements for my shell.

## Simplicity

The oh-my-zsh configuration and plugins tend to add complexity to the terminal environment, especially custom aliases. Overall, I have found `fish` to be much simpler regarding configuration and usage. My config file is only a few lines long and I'm only using one or two plugins for third party utilities (ex: [`fasd`](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) and [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)). I also found a very simple theme that only shows me what I need, similar to my previous `zsh` theme.

## Autosuggestion

This is the main reason I moved to `fish`. I originally was using the [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) which is "Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh". This is what drew me to fish, this is by far my most used feature. If I mistype a command, it will show in red to indicate that it's an invalid command. But, more importantly, while I type the prompt auto-suggests my previous commands (by recent and most used). This is far quicker than `ctrl+r` and usually shows me the command I want 80%+ of the time. Again, this is the main reason I use `fish` and one of my favorite productivity tools on my computer, period.

## Vim Mode

I've been a vim user for many years now. What I love about vim is it's intuitiveness and efficiency (once you've really gotten it down). I know `zsh` offers a vim-mode but I was happy to learn `fish` has one as well. It a sort of simplified `vi` hybrid but it does all I need it to do.

## Conclusion

`fish` is fast, simple, offers powerful autosuggestion and a vim mode. These are the most important thing for me right now in the terminal so I proudly made the switch to this friendly interactive shell and haven't looked back.
