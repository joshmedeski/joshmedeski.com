Experimenting with the new bun runtime with the astro framework.

**Note:** I ultimately didn't deploy Astro with bun because of bun's current limitatinos. You can watch the stream to see me work through the issues, or read the highlights below.

## Highlights

- Bun is fast! Install times are significantly faster
- Sharp isn't supported by bun yet, so I had back to Squoosh to get images working
- Netlify can't build, there seems to be something wrong with how dependencies are installed
- Vercel can build, but the View Transitions API doesn't work on the deployed site
