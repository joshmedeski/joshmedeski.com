Let's integrate GitHub into the terminal using the GitHub CLI, gh-dash, and the Octo Neovim plugin. In this live stream I experiment with adding new features to my tools to improve my experience with using GitHub on the command line.

## gh-dash

<GhRepo repo="dlvhdr/gh-dash" />

Here are a couple of features I added to gh-dash:

```yaml title="~/.config/gh-dash/config.yml"
keybindings:
  issues:
    - key: e
      command: >
        tmux display-popup -d {{.RepoPath}} -w 80% -h 90% -E 'nvim -c ":Octo issue edit {{.IssueNumber}}"'
    - key: i
      command: >
        tmux display-popup -d {{.RepoPath}} -w 80% -h 90% -E 'nvim -c ":Octo issue create"'
  prs:
    - key: O
      command: >
        tmux new-window -c {{.RepoPath}} 'nvim -c ":Octo pr edit {{.PrNumber}}"'
```

Also, in order to keep gh dash up-to-date, run the following command:

```sh
gh extension upgrade --all
```

## Octo.nvim

<GhRepo repo="pwntester/octo.nvim" />

Here is how I configure Octo.nvim using the Lazy.nvim plugin manager:

```lua title="~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/octo.lua"
return {
  "pwntester/octo.nvim",
  cmd = "Octo",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
  },
  config = function()
    require("octo").setup({ enable_builtin = true })
    vim.cmd([[hi OctoEditable guibg=none]])
  end,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>o", "<cmd>Octo<cr>", desc = "Octo" },
  },
}
```

I had previously created many custom leader key bindings but found I wasn't using them. So, thanks to [this issue I opened](https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim/issues/377), I can simplify it down to `<leader>o` which opens Telescope with all the potential Octo commands.

## lazygit

<GhRepo repo="jesseduffield/lazygit" />

Lastly, I integrated Octo more into my favorite git CLI tool, lazygit, by overwritting the "o" command with a custom command and setting the origional command to "O".

```yaml title="~/Library/Application Support/lazygit/config.yml
customCommands:
  - key: "o"
    command: "nvim -c ':Octo pr create'"
    context: "localBranches"
    loadingText: "Loading Octo"
    description: "Open pull request with Octo"
    subprocess: true
keybinding:
  branches:
    createPullRequest: "O"
```

Overall this was fun exploring these tools on the live stream. Each of the tools explored have different features to offer and I can see myself replacing a lot of my time on github.com with gh-dash, octo.nvim, and lazygit.
